//Grant dawson COSC 220 Project 1
This is a project to hold students information and class they have taken or plan to

Each StudentDB class is one school.

This is a interactive database of students and their courses they have take.
The program is total in the command promt and there is no need for the end user to use the main.cpp

Students hold the students:
  Name
  Date of birth (DOB)
  Major : This is made with a list and as more people use the program the list may get longer

Courses hold the students courses they have take and the info of the course:
  Department : This is sperate from the majors list but also a expanding list the user picks from and can add too
  Course number
  Semester
  Grade : This is another list the user picks from but can't be add too (N is for no final grade yet)

This will hold as many students/courses your ram will allow



Lab 8 ===========
  -I made it so the loops that ask for the users answer for the extra credits wont break
  -Fixed my valgrind segfault, Missed some edge case for removing a course, if head is null
  -Fixed remove course function, Could not delete the tail of the course list if more than 3
